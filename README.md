## Plans

I am always looking to enhance the Interactive Tree Visualizer. Some features I am considering for future updates:

1. **Advanced Export Options**: Introduce SVG export and data export in JSON format.
2. **Subtree Collapsing**: Implement the ability to collapse and expand subtrees for better navigation of large
   structures.
3. **Accessibility Improvements**: Add and improve mouse and keyboard navigation and shortcuts.
4. **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Allow users to rearrange nodes by dragging and dropping.
5. **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Implement a history stack for undoing and redoing tree modifications.
6. **Themes**: Offer multiple color themes and allow users to create custom themes.
